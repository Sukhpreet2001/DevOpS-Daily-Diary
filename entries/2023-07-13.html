  <h3>BRANCHING:</h3>
  <p>Branching in Git refers to the process of creating a separate line of development within a repository. It allows multiple developers to work on different features or bug fixes simultaneously without interfering with each other's work. Git's branching mechanism is lightweight and efficient, making it easy to create, switch between, and merge branches.</p>
  <p><strong>BENEFITS OF BRANCHING:</strong> Isolation of work, Parallel development, Feature isolation and testing, Branch versioning and history etc.</p>

  <h4>TASK:</h4>
  <p>Push code into branches and then try to create branches in your local repository.</p>

  <h3>GITHUB PAGES:</h3>
  <p>GitHub Pages is a feature provided by GitHub that allows users to easily create and host static websites directly from their GitHub repositories. It simplifies the process of publishing web content, making it accessible to a wide audience.</p>
  <p><strong>BENEFITS:</strong> Hosting, Repository Integration, Automatic Deployment, URL Structure etc.</p>

  <h4>TASK:</h4>
  <p>Create GitHub pages and upload classwork summary.</p>

  <h3>DOCKER:</h3>
  <p>Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to automate the deployment and management of applications within lightweight, isolated software containers. It provides a way to package an application and its dependencies into a standardized unit called a container.</p>
  <p>Containers are lightweight, standalone, and portable environments that include all the necessary libraries, dependencies, and configuration files required for the application to run. Docker allows these containers to be created, distributed, and run consistently across different environments, such as development machines, testing environments, and production servers.</p>

  <h4>PREREQUISITES:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Compatible operating system: Ensure your operating system supports Docker (Linux, macOS, or Windows).</li>
    <li>Sufficient hardware resources: Have enough CPU, memory, and storage capacity to accommodate the host system and containers.</li>
    <li>Familiarity with containerization concepts: Understand Docker images, containers, Dockerfiles, and container orchestration.</li>
    <li>Understanding of networking concepts: Know IP addressing, ports, and networking protocols to manage container connectivity.</li>
    <li>Command-line interface (CLI) skills: Familiarize yourself with Docker CLI commands and syntax.</li>
    <li>Docker installation: Successfully install Docker by following the appropriate instructions for your operating system.</li>
    <li>Knowledge of containerization use cases: Understand how Docker can be utilized for development, testing, deployment, and microservices architectures.</li>
    <li>Awareness of the Docker ecosystem: Explore related tools like Docker Compose, Docker Swarm, and Kubernetes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>NEED:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Application portability between development, testing, and production environments.</li>
    <li>Isolation and efficient management of dependencies.</li>
    <li>Optimized resource utilization with lightweight containers.</li>
    <li>Fast startup times and easy scalability.</li>
    <li>Version control and easy rollbacks.</li>
    <li>Support for microservices architectures.</li>
    <li>A vast ecosystem and community support for pre-built images and tools.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>VIRTUAL MACHINE:</h3>
  <p>A virtual machine (VM) is a software emulation of a physical computer that runs an operating system (OS) and applications. It enables multiple operating systems to run simultaneously on a single physical machine, with each VM acting as an independent entity.</p>
  <p>Here are some key aspects of virtual machines:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hypervisor</li>
    <li>Operating Systems</li>
    <li>Resource Allocation</li>
    <li>Isolation</li>
    <li>Snapshots and Cloning</li>
    <li>Migration and Scalability</li>
    <li>Legacy and Compatibility</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>CONTAINER:</h3>
  <p>In Docker, a container is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and dependencies. Containers in Docker are created from Docker images and provide an isolated and consistent environment for running applications.</p>
  <p>Here are some key aspects of containers in Docker:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Isolation</li>
    <li>Portability</li>
    <li>Lightweight</li>
    <li>Images</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>TASK:</h4>
  <p>Different types of API's with its needs:- There are several types of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), each serving specific needs and purposes based on the nature of the systems or services they interact with. Here are some common types of APIs and their respective needs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Web APIs:</strong> Web APIs, also known as HTTP APIs or REST APIs, are designed to enable communication and data exchange between different web-based applications over the internet. They are widely used for web and mobile application development and provide a standard way of accessing and manipulating resources through HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.</li>
    <li><strong>Database APIs:</strong> Database APIs, such as ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) or JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), provide an interface to interact with databases. They allow developers to execute queries, retrieve, insert, update, and delete data from a database system. These APIs ensure proper integration and efficient management of data in database-driven applications.</li>
    <li><strong>Operating System APIs:</strong> Operating System APIs, also known as system APIs, are used by developers to interact with the underlying operating system. They provide a way to access system resources and perform tasks such as file operations, network communication, process management, and hardware control. Operating System APIs are crucial for developing system-level applications and utilities.</li>
    <li><strong>Library APIs:</strong> Library APIs, also known as software APIs or SDKs (Software Development Kits), provide a set of pre-built functions and classes that developers can utilize to build applications. These APIs abstract complex functionalities, allowing developers to leverage existing code and tools to simplify development and accelerate time-to-market.</li>
    <li><strong>Hardware APIs:</strong> Hardware APIs allow software applications to interact with specific hardware devices or components. They provide the necessary interfaces and protocols to control and access hardware functionalities such as sensors, cameras, printers, or microcontrollers. Hardware APIs are vital for developing applications that interact with physical devices.</li>
    <li><strong>Messaging APIs:</strong> Messaging APIs facilitate communication and data exchange between different software systems or applications. They enable the exchange of messages or notifications in real-time, asynchronously, or through event-driven architectures. Messaging APIs are commonly used in chat applications, collaboration tools, or event-driven architectures like publish-subscribe systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Social Media APIs:</strong> Social Media APIs, such as those provided by platforms like Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, allow developers to integrate their applications with social media platforms.</li>
