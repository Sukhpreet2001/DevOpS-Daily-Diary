    <h2>Presentation Day</h2>
    <p>Today marked the Round Table meeting, where each team presented their respective projects. We confidently showcased our Recruitment Management System, highlighting the efforts and progress made during its development.</p>
    
    <h3>Project Presentation</h3>
    <p>During the presentation, we demonstrated the various features and functionalities of our Recruitment Management System. We showcased the homepage displaying job vacancies, the application management system, interview scheduling, and applicant tracking capabilities. The team collectively explained the project's architecture, technologies used, and the challenges overcome during the development process.</p>
    
    <h3>Evaluation and Voting</h3>
    <p>After all the teams presented their projects, an evaluation was conducted to assess the projects based on various criteria, such as functionality, user experience, design, and innovation. Each team provided constructive feedback and insights to improve each other's projects.</p>
    
    <p>Finally, a voting session was held to select the best project among all the presentations. The team of Gurneet and Aman's Spotify clone project earned the honor of being voted the best project by their peers. Congratulations to Team-E on their remarkable achievement!</p>
    
    <h3>Learnings and Takeaways</h3>
    <p>The Round Table meeting provided us with a valuable opportunity to learn from other teams' projects, understand different approaches to problem-solving, and gain insights into innovative ideas. The experience of presenting our project and receiving feedback further enhanced our understanding of project development and presentation skills.</p>
    
    <p>Overall, it was an enriching day, and we look forward to implementing the feedback received during the evaluation to further improve our Recruitment Management System and enhance its functionality and user experience.</p>
