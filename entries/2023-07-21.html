  <h2>Solving Errors</h2>

  <p>Today's focus was on reformatting our base project to fit the chosen topic - Recruitment Management System. We made significant progress in creating the homepage, which displays job vacancies retrieved from the connected database. The project's architecture involves PHP and Apache server to establish the connection with the database.</p>
  
  <h3>Recruitment Management System</h3>
  <p>The Recruitment Management System is a crucial tool for managing the recruitment process in an organization. It streamlines the hiring process, making it more efficient and effective. The system typically includes features like job posting, candidate application management, interview scheduling, and applicant tracking.</p>
  
  <h3>Project Development Progress</h3>
  <p>We successfully transformed our base project into a Recruitment Management System. Key accomplishments for the day include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reformatted the project to suit the specific requirements of the Recruitment Management System.</li>
    <li>Developed the homepage, which displays the available job vacancies to potential candidates.</li>
    <li>Established a connection with the database using PHP and Apache server to retrieve job vacancy information.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Team Collaboration</h3>
  <p>Today was a tiring day, but we received valuable support and assistance from our teammates, Gurneet and Amanjot. Their contributions were instrumental in making progress with the project.</p>
  
  <p>As we move forward, we aim to continue working collaboratively to build a robust and user-friendly Recruitment Management System. The journey has been challenging but rewarding, and we look forward to further development and improvements in the coming days.</p>
